# LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) Buffer Project

This project implements a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) buffer data structure using C programming language. The LIFO buffer provides operations to initialize the buffer, push items into the buffer, pop items from the buffer, check if the buffer is full or empty, and read/print all items in the buffer.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git`
2. Compile the source code: `gcc main.c Lifo.c -o lifo`
3. Run the executable: `./lifo`

## Usage

After running the program, the LIFO buffer will be initialized with a specified length. The program then demonstrates the usage of various LIFO operations, including push, pop, and read all.
