# FIFO (First-In-First-Out) Buffer Project

This project implements a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer data structure using C programming language. The FIFO buffer provides operations to initialize the buffer, enqueue items into the buffer, dequeue items from the buffer, check if the buffer is full or empty, and read/print all items in the buffer.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git`
2. Compile the source code: `gcc main.c FIFO.c -o fifo`
3. Run the executable: `./fifo`

## Usage

After running the program, the FIFO buffer will be initialized with a specified length. The program then demonstrates the usage of various FIFO operations, including enqueue, dequeue, and read all.
